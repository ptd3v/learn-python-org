#Numpy arrays are great alternatives to Python Lists.
#Create 2 lists, height and weight.
height = [1.87,  1.87, 1.82, 1.91, 1.90, 1.85]
weight = [81.65, 97.52, 95.25, 92.98, 86.18, 88.45]

#Import the numpy package as np
import numpy as np

#Create 2 numpy arrays from height and weight
np_height = np.array(height)
np_weight = np.array(weight)

print(type(np_height))

#Calculate bmi
bmi = np_weight / np_height ** 2

#Print the result
print(bmi)

#For a boolean response
bmi > 23

#Print only those observations above 23
bmi[bmi > 23]

weight_kg = [81.65, 97.52, 95.25, 92.98, 86.18, 88.45]

import numpy as np

#Create a numpy array np_weight_kg from weight_kg
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_kg)

#Create np_weight_lbs from np_weight_kg
np_weight_lbs = np_weight_kg / 2.2

#Print out np_weight_lbs
print(np_weight_lbs)
print(np_weight_kg)
